Component of this Project:
    
    • OpenWeatherMap API fetch to return current weather data.
    • Search bar where you can input cities or countries to find out the weather.
    • By selecting the 'Get Device Location', the current latitude and longitude of the device is sent to the OpenWeatherMap API and you will receieve your current locations weather information.
    • We use Id value that API provides us, and then we are shown custom weather icon/image according to the weather condition.
    
v2 Project enhancements:

    • Details by entering the city name or you can also get your current location weather details by clicking on the “Get Device Location” button. 
    • If you enter an invalid city name then an error message will be shown. 
    • Many weather details in this app like temperature in Farhenheit, weather conditions, location, feels like, and humidity.
