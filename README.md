In this project I will be utilizing HTML,CSS and JS to build a working simple weather app. 

Project Files:

    Index.html Contains all our HTML properties.
    Index.Js Contains our Javascript properties.
    Style.css Contains our CSS properties.
    
Component of this Project:
    
    • Restful API fetch to return current weather data.
    • Search bar where you can input cities or countries to find out the weather.
    • Display Screen: It displays the location, date and current degrees in Fahrenheit as well as the hi-low for results.

Future components to be added in this Project:
    • Get the details by entering the city name or you can also get your current location weather details by clicking on the “Get Device Location” button. 
    • If you enter an invalid city name then an error message will be shown. 
    • Try to get many weather details in this app like temperature in Celsius, weather conditions, location, feels like, and humidity.
